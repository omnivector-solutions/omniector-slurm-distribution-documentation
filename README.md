<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

`<charm_name>` allows `<insert_target_audience/service/package>` to do `<action/task_it_does>`.

Additional information text about what the charm does. Your introduction should be around 2 or 3 sentences. Don't go overboard, people won't read it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A modern Python installation
- [sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Building the documentation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Charm-Name.git
    ```
1. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. Build the HTML docs:
    ```sh
    make html
