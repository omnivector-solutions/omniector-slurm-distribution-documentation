Welcome to the documentation for the Omnivector Slurm Distribution!
===================================================================
This documentation is the source of truth for information pertaining
to deploying and operating the Omnivector Slurm Distribution (OSD).

The Omnivector Slurm Distribution is built with codified operations
called "charms". Charms are custom curated operations code that are used
to automate and support the charmed application lifecycle.

The `slurm-charms <https://github.com/omnivector-solutions/slurm-charms/>`_
are at the heart of our operations suite and encapsulate the operational
know-how and automation needed to facilitate the lifecycle of a SLURM cluster.

The `slurm-bundles <https://github.com/omnivector-solutions/slurm-bundles/>`_
define base configurations for the slurm deployments on different clouds.

Follow the documentation below to better understand how to get up and running
and take advantage of the full range of features contained in the Omnivector Slurm Distribution!
