The ``slurmd`` charm contains support for Infiniband driver lifecycle
operations.

Using the ``slurmd`` charm *actions* we can configure a repository and install
infiniband drivers from a named repository.

The general workflow for installing Infiniband drivers from a custom repository
includes setting up the driver repository, installing the drivers, and
rebooting the node (in that order).


By default, OSD uses the Mellanox repository for OFED 5.3. If you want a
different version, or a different repository, you can create a text file
describing the repository and configure the charms to use it. For example, to
use Mellanox OFED 4.9 for CentOS7, you can download the ``.repo`` file
available `here
<https://linux.mellanox.com/public/repo/mlnx_ofed/4.9-2.2.4.0/rhel7.9/mellanox_mlnx_ofed.repo>`_.
The repository configuration file for Ubuntu is `here
<https://linux.mellanox.com/public/repo/mlnx_ofed/4.9-2.2.4.0/ubuntu20.04/mellanox_mlnx_ofed.list>`_.

For example, to download a repository file for CentOS and install the drivers
in a loop to cover all 150 compute nodes:

.. code-blocK:: bash

   curl -O repository \
        https://linux.mellanox.com/public/repo/mlnx_ofed/4.9-2.2.4.0/rhel7.9/mellanox_mlnx_ofed.repo

   for i in {{0..150}}; do
   	juju run-action compute/$i set-infiniband-repo repo="$(cat repository)" --wait
   	juju run-action compute/$i install-infiniband
   done

The charm will install a package named ``mlnx-ofed-all``. Note that this
procedure takes some time. After the drivers are installed, you need to reboot
the nodes.
