OSD installs `LBNL Node Health Check (NHC) <https://github.com/mej/nhc>`_ by
default in the ``slurmd`` charm. The base configuration file contains only
basic checks, and you can easily extend it to match your own cluster.

For example, suppose you want to also check for: 100 Gb/sec infiniband, and the
``/scratch`` partition to be mounted as ``r/w``. The easiest way to do so is to
create a ``custom-conf.nhc`` file with those checks:

::

   * || check_fs_mount_rw -f /scratch
   * || check_hw_ib 100

And then configure your ``slurmd`` application to use it:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ juju config slurmd nhc-conf="$(cat custom-conf.nhc)"

Note that this will append your custom configurations to the ``nhc.conf`` file,
without overwriting the file.

We also provide an action to see the currently used ``nhc.conf``, which
contains our base checks in addition to your custom ones:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ juju run-action slurmd/leader show-nhc-config --wait

The default settings used in ``slurm.conf`` for NHC are as follows:

::

   HealthCheckProgram=/sbin/nhc
   HealthCheckInterval=600
   HealthCheckNodeState=ANY,CYCLE

It is possible to change the interval (in seconds) and the node states:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ juju config slurmd health-check-interval=300
   $ juju config slurmd health-check-state="CYCLE,ANY"

Please refer to the
`slurm.conf documentation <https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html>`_ for
configuration details.
